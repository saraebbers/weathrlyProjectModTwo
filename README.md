Weathrly is a mod 2 project that includes use of React for web design.  The goal of the app is to utilize API data to populate a simple weather prediction page.  User should be able to see current weather, a seven hour forecast and a ten day forecast.  Last searched location should perpetuate in local storage upon refresh.  Initial wire frames for application are listed below.
